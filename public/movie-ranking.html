<h1>The Best Movies According to Max</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>This one is my favorite sci-fi movie of all time, I'm a sucker for astronomy stuff</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
    <p>I would say the whole trilogy, but I will still count it as one and to be honest, I think this one is tied with Interstellar in my top 1, fantasy stuff at its FINEST</p>
<h3>I, Robot</h3>
    <p>Robots and Will Smith is the perfect mix I never knew I needed in my life</p>
