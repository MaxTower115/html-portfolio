<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Who am I? I'm tragedy</p>

<p>I studied mechatronics for like 2 years, then realized that wasn't for me (Plus the college was utter ****), I dropped out a couple of years after and then started studying Digital Animation and Video Game Development, which wasn't bad, I really REALLY liked the whole stuff about creating games: 3D Modeling, animation, texturing, programming, level and game design, etc. The only dissappointing bit is: Getting a job as a game coder is HELLA DIFFICULT out there</p>

<p>So right now, I'm someone who is learning everything about fullstack development as soon as possible, but dont get me wrong, I'm still looking for a job as a Unity programmer (If you need a programmer you know where to contact me)</p>
